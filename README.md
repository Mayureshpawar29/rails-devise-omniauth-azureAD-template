# **Rails Devise Omniauth AzureAD Template**

Rails Devise Omniauth AzureAD Template is a starter template for building Ruby on Rails applications that integrate with Azure Active Directory (AzureAD) using Devise and Omniauth. This template provides a basic setup to authenticate users via AzureAD and offers a starting point for developing applications that require AzureAD authentication.

## **Features**

- User authentication with AzureAD using Devise and Omniauth
- Integration with AzureAD's OAuth 2.0 authorization flow
- Preconfigured routes, controllers, and views for user registration, login, and logout
- Support for retrieving user information from AzureAD
- Bootstrap styling for a responsive user interface

## **Getting Started**

To get started with the Rails Devise Omniauth AzureAD Template, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/rails-devise-omniauth-azureAD-template.git
    ```
    
2. Install the required gems:
    
    ```
    bundle install
    ```
    
3. Set up the database:
    
    ```
    rails db:setup
    ```
    
4. Configure AzureAD credentials:
    - Open **`config/initializers/devise.rb`** and replace **`YOUR_APP_ID`** and **`YOUR_APP_SECRET`** with your AzureAD application's client ID and client secret respectively.
    - Update the AzureAD tenant domain in **`config/initializers/omniauth.rb`**.
5. Start the Rails server:
    
    ```
    rails server
    ```
    
6. Open your web browser and visit **`http://localhost:3000`** to see the application in action.

## **Customization**

The Rails Devise Omniauth AzureAD Template provides a foundation for your application, but you may want to customize it further. Here are a few areas you might consider:

- Views: Customize the appearance and layout of the registration, login, and user profile views located in the **`app/views/devise`** and **`app/views/users`** directories.
- Routes: Modify the routes defined in **`config/routes.rb`** to add new functionality or change existing routes.
- Controllers: Extend or modify the existing controllers in **`app/controllers`** to add your custom logic.
- Models: Expand the functionality of the User model located in **`app/models/user.rb`** to store additional user information or integrate with other models.
